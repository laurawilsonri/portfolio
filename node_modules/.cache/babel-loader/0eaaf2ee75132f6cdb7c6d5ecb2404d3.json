They sit tightly next to people they don't know, \n                zone out to their go-to playlist, and silently pass by the lively streets of their city. Their daily commutes\n                have become isolating and unfruitful.

Despite their differences, \n            we felt that each sketch had valuable features we could include in our final prototype. As a result,\n             we came up with a prototype that incorporated many of the different sketches together: \n             the navigation came from sketch 1, the calendars came from sketch 4, the filter/search layouts \n             came from sketch 3, and the information grid layout came from sketch 2.</p>\n\n        <h3>Step 2: High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>\n        <iframe style={{\"border\": \"1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)\"}} width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2Ff4bIRsOei5Z3gbAo67J8wK2D%2FIterative%3Fnode-id%3D2%253A51%26scaling%3Dscale-down&chrome=DOCUMENTATION\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n        <p>We then created an interactive prototype using Figma.

Then we analyzed the data and turned it into \"heat maps.\" Below are two of the resulting \"heat maps.\" \n            The closer to red the shade is, the greater amount of time the user spent looking at that area.</p>\n        <img src={hotel_eyetracking_home}></img>\n        <img src={hotel_eyetracking_booking}></img>\n\n\n        <h3>Step 4: Interpretation</h3>\n        <p>On the homepage, the user's focus largely remained on the four central icons, as the heat map displays\n             the deepest red near the center of the icons.  This is what we desired from our design -- to \n             <b>improve efficiency with very clear, direct paths of use.</b></p>\n\n        <p>Generally, <b>the user was able to navigate to the pages and interact with components in the order \n            we expected</b> and the heat maps reflect that the user was able to find the relevant information \n            for each subtask successfully. However, there was some confusion in finding the contract for \n            a customer. In a future iteration of the design, we would ease this struggle by including \n            the contract verification in the general information panel, where the user examined the \n            most frequently in her search to find the contract. </p>\n\n        <h3>The Team</h3>\n        <p>This project was one of several completed for UIUX during Fall 2018, completed in partnership \n            with three other students.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Want to learn more?
