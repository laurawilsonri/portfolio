structures</b> in a new, fun way!  \n               Students fly around a rocket through dataverse, a universe where each planet offers a game that \n               is based on a specific data structure. Once they master single-player planets, they can <b>compete against \n               their friends in the multiplayer arena</b> or buy rocket skins and speed upgrades at the shop.</p>\n            \n            <img src={dataverse_home}></img>\n            <label>The welcome screen for dataverse informs users of the basic goal of the website and how to interact with the interface in a concise popup.</label>\n           \n            <h3>My Role</h3>\n            <p>This website was the final project for my Software Engineering class, completed with 3 other students over the course of 4 weeks.</p>\n            <p>The areas of the project I worked on included:\n            <ul>\n                <li>The frontend for the individual games <em>(Reactjs)</em></li>\n                <li>The graphics, art, and iconography <em>(Adobe Illustrator)</em></li>\n                <li>The backend integration and support for multiplayer <em>(Java)</em></li>\n            </ul>\n            </p>\n            \n            <h3>Takeaways</h3>\n            <p>\n                <b>Make your program extensible (yes, even the frontend!).</b><br/>\n                  Our site consists of many planets, including 6 minigames. This resulted in a LOT of pages and popups that were quite similar.\n                  Using React, we were able to create Components that could be reused to prevent repetetive code. Our games also followed a similar pattern\n                  of \"do x to earn y points in z seconds\", so we were able to abstract much of the game logic (backend and frontend). This made adding new games\n                  extremely fast and easy (in fact, we added an entirely new minigame planet the day before our presentation)!</p>\n            <p>\n                <b>Websockets can be a nightmare.</b><br/>\n                    We used websockets to send and receive messages between the frontend and the backend. \n                    This resulted in a long, messy list of message types, so to organize the madness, we created a \n                    MessageManager. To create a new message, we would register it through\n                    the MessageManager, along with a handler for that message. \n                    Then, the MessageManager would receive messages and direct them to the proper handlers.\n                    This made websockets really manageable and extensible for our project!</p>\n            <p>\n                <b>User testing is critical</b><br/>\n                To make sure our site was both informative and fun, we tested it on almost 100 8th graders from Lincoln Middle School. \n                The feedback we received was incredibly insightful-- \n                we learned that the students thought the games were really fun, and especially enjoyed competing against eachother in the multiplayer\n                area, but they felt like they didn't learn a lot about data structures. In response, we added a \"Learn More\" page for each game that \n                teaches about each data structure in more depth, and made the games a bit harder so that you would need to understand the data structure to\n                perform well. In addition, we were able to improve the usability of the site based on specific feedback from the students!\n            </p>\n            </div>;\n            }\n\n\n    getJamStagePage() {\n        return <div className=\"project-expansion\">\n            <h3>Overview</h3>\n                 <p>My final project for MUSC1001: Generative Animation, Jam Stage is an audio-reactive virtual environment that uses generative animation techniques to match the mood of a given audio piece.  \n                     It was built for the web using Three.js and WebAudio. </p>\n                \n                <img src={jam_zoomin}></img>\n                <label>The stage begins as a row of particles, whose </label>\n\n                <img src={jam_zoomout}></img>\n                <label>Label for PIC</label>\n            \n                <h3>How I made it</h3>\n                <p> I used <b>Three.js</b> to generate a dynamic particle system and Web Audio to get the data from the user’s audio file. \n                With the data received from Web Audio, I grouped the amplitudes of the frequencies into averages, increasing the group size \n                as the frequency increased to account for the overrepresentation of higher frequencies. Then, I mapped this data onto the \n                movement of the particles. Each column of particles represents one frequency group (lower on the left, higher on the right), \n                and its height represents that frequency group's amplitude. The number of particles that move within that column is \n                determined by the total frequency sum (so if the sum is 50% of max, 50% of the particles of each column are randomly \n                chosen to move). </p>\n\n                <p>I also added sinusoidal movement for the x and z positions of the particles so that the system is also engaged in some \n                    sort of movement. The maximum z position is determined by the total amplitude of all the frequencies. </p>\n\n                <p>Some other techniques include:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li> The colors of each particle are randomized, but weighted towards purple for consistency, and are also affected by the amplitude of their corresponding frequencies.</li>\n                    <li> The size of each particle is representative of the loudness of the audio.</li>\n                    <li> The camera moves with the particles, using the mean location of all the particles to offset all the particles’ y values.</li>\n                </ul>\n                \n                \n                <h3>Spotlight Challenge</h3>\n                <p>\n                    <b>TODO 1</b><br/>\n                    TODO description 1</p>\n                <p>\n                    <b>TODO 2</b><br/>\n                    TODO description 2</p>\n                </div>;\n                }\n\n    render(){\n        let project_count = 0;\n\n        return (\n            <div id=\"code-projects\">\n                <h1>What I've been Coding Up</h1>\n\n                <DisplayGrid items={this.state.projects.map((p) => <PopupButton key={\"project-count-\" + project_count++} \n                    title={p.title} \n                    subtitle={p.logline} \n                    thumbnail={p.thumbnail} \n                    keywords={p.languages}\n                    launchLink={p.launchLink}\n                    pageHTML={p.pageHTML}/>)} />\n           \n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default CodeProjects;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
